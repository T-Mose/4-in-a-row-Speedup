Connect Four board representations for a performance lab.

- Implement `OptimizedBoard` win-detection logic on top of `ConnectFourBoard`. See `NaiveBoard` for inspiration but that is very suboptimal.
- Verify correctness with `ConnectFourBoardTest`.
- Compare runtime characteristics using `PerformanceTest`.
